# EmojiArt

Welcome to EmojiArt!
This repository contains the code for a project developed while following along with the Stanford course
[CS193p - Developing Apps for iOS using SwiftUI](https://cs193p.sites.stanford.edu/2023), which is available online.

## Overview
EmojiArt is a fun project where users can create art using emojis. It allows you to drag and drop emojis onto a canvas
to create your own masterpiece.
It is **optimized for iPad** for now.

## Features
* Customize the background picture on the canvas
* Drag and drop emojis onto the canvas
* Move emojis around the canvas
* Resize emojis
* Delete emojis
* Save and load your EmojiArt creations

## Credits
The initial codebase and structure of this project were directly influenced by the course materials.
I coded along during the lectures (lectures 10 - 12), including my own notes and using my preferred syntax.
Subsequently, additional features were added during homework assignments, expanding the functionality of the
application.
This was a great way to brush up on Swift and learn some additional best practices.

I would like to express my gratitude to the instructor of the course for his excellent lectures, wonderfully
detailed assignments, and online resources.
